* To bootstrap:-
  * Make sure there's cmake and 
  * pushd somehwere
  * git submodule add https://github.com/LuaDist/Repository.git luadist
  * pushd luadist
  * git submodule update --init --recursive bootstrap
  * ./install bootstrap (seems to need several kicks due to network errors)
* Post-installation
  * pushd luadist/_install/bin (_install is the root)
  * ./luadist install modulex-ver

* How do we use it with LuaJIT?

It seems it is possible to get hslua to use LuaJIT: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslua
https://luapower.com/ - lots of luajit bindings

Ljsyscall (syscall) but Justin McCormack

Use luaffi for LuaJIT compatible FFI in Lua: https://github.com/jmckaskill/luaffi; newer one at https://github.com/facebook/luaffifb
	- uses luarocks internal build to do build

Luarocks is the standard dependency manager, but I really loathe its design (it's a poor apt + deb). That said, it should be possible to gut the code from src/luarocks/*.lua, add a rockspec parser and have a program that will read and install rockspecs, with 'on-the-fly' compilation of libraries (eg https://github.com/keplerproject/luarocks/blob/master/src/luarocks/build/make.lua)
